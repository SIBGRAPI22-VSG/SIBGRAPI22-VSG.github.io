<div>Miranda is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago. 
 He is interested in developing techniques that allow for the interactive visual analysis of large-scale data, combining methods from visualization, 
 data management, machine learning, and computer graphics. In particular, he focuses on how visual data analytics can help address different problems 
 cities face by integrating data with different resolutions and from different sources. 
 He has worked closely with domain experts from different fields, including urban planning, architecture, and public health. 
 The outcomes of these collaborations included not only research published in visualization, database, and artificial intelligence venues, 
 but also systems that were made available to experts in academia, industry, and government agencies.

<p><strong>Title: Visualizing Environmental Justice Conditions of Overburdened Communities</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract: According to environmental justice principles, environmental degradation should not disproportionately impact communities. 
Overburdened communities are those where environmental burdens (e.g., high pollution, proximity to hazardous facilities) and socioeconomic 
  disparities (e.g., low income or minority status) act cumulatively to produce harmful living conditions. 
  Identifying disparities in the spatial distribution of environmental degradation is therefore a prerequisite for validating the state of environmental 
  justice in a geographic region. Under ideal circumstances, environmental risk assessment is a preferred metric, but only when exposure levels have 
  been quantified reliably after estimating the risk. Visualization systems are critical to design environmental justice policy interventions, where 
  stakeholders can identify overburdened communities by linking burdens and socioeconomic disparities on a map. 
  However, there is great variation in how these systems measure and visualize both burden and disparities, leading to different approaches to 
  identify overburdened communities and making environmental justice data accessible to the public. In this talk, I will 1) present a series of 
  systems developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers that use a community-based participatory design approach involving the southwest 
  communities of Chicago, and 2) highlight visualization research opportunities related to environmental justice.
