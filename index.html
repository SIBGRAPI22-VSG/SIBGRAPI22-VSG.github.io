<div>Miranda is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago. 
 He is interested in developing techniques that allow for the interactive visual analysis of large-scale data, combining methods from visualization, 
 data management, machine learning, and computer graphics. In particular, he focuses on how visual data analytics can help address different problems 
 cities face by integrating data with different resolutions and from different sources. 
 He has worked closely with domain experts from different fields, including urban planning, architecture, and public health. 
 The outcomes of these collaborations included not only research published in visualization, database, and artificial intelligence venues, 
 but also systems that were made available to experts in academia, industry, and government agencies.

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Visualizing Environmental Justice Conditions of Overburdened Communities</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> According to environmental justice principles, environmental degradation should not disproportionately impact communities. 
Overburdened communities are those where environmental burdens (e.g., high pollution, proximity to hazardous facilities) and socioeconomic 
  disparities (e.g., low income or minority status) act cumulatively to produce harmful living conditions. 
  Identifying disparities in the spatial distribution of environmental degradation is therefore a prerequisite for validating the state of environmental 
  justice in a geographic region. Under ideal circumstances, environmental risk assessment is a preferred metric, but only when exposure levels have 
  been quantified reliably after estimating the risk. Visualization systems are critical to design environmental justice policy interventions, where 
  stakeholders can identify overburdened communities by linking burdens and socioeconomic disparities on a map. 
  However, there is great variation in how these systems measure and visualize both burden and disparities, leading to different approaches to 
  identify overburdened communities and making environmental justice data accessible to the public. In this talk, I will 1) present a series of 
  systems developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers that use a community-based participatory design approach involving the southwest 
  communities of Chicago, and 2) highlight visualization research opportunities related to environmental justice.

 <p> Title: Automatic redesign of societally injudicious colormaps in visualizations </p>
 <p> Abstract: The use of colors in visualizations is widely used nowadays. However, inappropriate use of colors can lead to misinterpretation of the 
  results. This problem is even worse for visually impaired people. We propose a method to identify and automatically redesign visualizations encoding 
  data using colors. On the one hand, this mechanism allows the automatic redesign of visualizations that may be inscrutable or offensive to certain 
  social groups, such as the visually impaired or the culturally sensitive. On the other hand, it equips researchers and journalists with an exploratory 
  tool to massively assess the accessibility of color maps in large corpora of graphics. This task is essential to properly recommend procedures to 
  improve the amenity of visualizations in specific communities. Moreover, our automated approach improves the semantic characterization of color maps 
  in graphs by exploiting the textual features of graphs. This is a preeminent operation in properly communicating visually encoded statistical data 
  attributes to visually impaired people.</p>

 <p> Title:  Crime prediction and prevention using police patrolling data: challenges and prospects</p>
 <p> Abstract: Spatiotemporal crime analysis and prediction aim at identifying criminal patterns in space and time. In previous work, crime prediction 
  has been performed by identifying hotspots from data, which means  areas of high criminal activity on the streets. By focusing efforts on such sites, 
  police patrolling is expected to be more efficient, thus reducing criminal activity. However, there is a lack of studies investigating how police 
  patrolling affects crime, and whether it can be a predictor of crime activity. In this paper we discuss the main challenges of this problem, and 
  describe some work in progress towards developing a robust methodology to represent, visually analyze, and build predictors for criminal activity, 
  considering both criminal and police patrolling spatiotemporal data. As a case study, we use real datasets from the Military Police of the state of 
  Alagoas, Brazil (PM-AL).</p>

 <p> Title: SDA-Vis: A Visualization System for Student Dropout Analysis Based on Counterfactual Exploration </p>
 <p> Abstract: High and persistent dropout rates represent one of the biggest challenges for improving the efficiency of the educational system, 
  particularly in underdeveloped countries. A range of features influences college dropouts, with some belonging to the educational field and others to 
  non-educational fields. Understanding the interplay of these variables to identify a student as a potential dropout could help decision-makers 
  interpret the situation and decide what they should do next to reduce student dropout rates based on corrective actions. 
  In this presentation, I will present SDA-Vis, a visualization system that supports counterfactual explanations for student dropout dynamics, 
  considering various academic, social, and economic variables. In contrast to conventional systems, our approach provides information about 
  feature-perturbed versions of a student using counterfactual explanations. SDA-Vis comprises a set of linked views that allow users to identify 
  variables alteration to chance predefined student situations.</p>

<p> 15:15 - 16:00 <strong> Panel: (Topic to be decided)</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
 <p> Organizer: Filip Sadlo </p>
 <p> Panelists: Claudio Silva (New York University - USA), Jorge Poco (Fundacao Getulio Vargas - BR) and Fabio Miranda (University of Illinois - USA)</p>
 <!-- <p> In recent years, research in urban, sports, societal and governmental data visualization have made tremendous progress, giving rise to successful visual analytic systems. 
  However, several open and provocative questions, mainly regarding ethic and fairness, are taking place. How the visualization community is handling those issues is the main topoic of this panel.
