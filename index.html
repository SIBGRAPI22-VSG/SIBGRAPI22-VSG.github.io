<div>Miranda is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago. 
 He is interested in developing techniques that allow for the interactive visual analysis of large-scale data, combining methods from visualization, 
 data management, machine learning, and computer graphics. In particular, he focuses on how visual data analytics can help address different problems 
 cities face by integrating data with different resolutions and from different sources. 
 He has worked closely with domain experts from different fields, including urban planning, architecture, and public health. 
 The outcomes of these collaborations included not only research published in visualization, database, and artificial intelligence venues, 
 but also systems that were made available to experts in academia, industry, and government agencies.

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Visualizing Environmental Justice Conditions of Overburdened Communities</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> According to environmental justice principles, environmental degradation should not disproportionately impact communities. 
Overburdened communities are those where environmental burdens (e.g., high pollution, proximity to hazardous facilities) and socioeconomic 
  disparities (e.g., low income or minority status) act cumulatively to produce harmful living conditions. 
  Identifying disparities in the spatial distribution of environmental degradation is therefore a prerequisite for validating the state of environmental 
  justice in a geographic region. Under ideal circumstances, environmental risk assessment is a preferred metric, but only when exposure levels have 
  been quantified reliably after estimating the risk. Visualization systems are critical to design environmental justice policy interventions, where 
  stakeholders can identify overburdened communities by linking burdens and socioeconomic disparities on a map. 
  However, there is great variation in how these systems measure and visualize both burden and disparities, leading to different approaches to 
  identify overburdened communities and making environmental justice data accessible to the public. In this talk, I will 1) present a series of 
  systems developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers that use a community-based participatory design approach involving the southwest 
  communities of Chicago, and 2) highlight visualization research opportunities related to environmental justice.

 <p> Title: Automatic redesign of societally injudicious colormaps in visualizations </p>
 <p> Abstract: In this work, we propose a method for automatically identifying and subsequently redesigning colormaps within explicitly legended data visualizations; thereby, we exploit the extraction and thereupon the interpretation of the chosen color palettes. On the one hand, this mechanism enables the automatic redesign of visualizations in which the color encoding of the underlying data may be inscrutable or offensive for particular social groups, as for the visually impaired or for the culturally sensitive. On the other hand, it endows reseachers and journalists with an exploratory tool for massively evaluating the accessibility of the colormaps in large corpora of charts, an important investigation to properly recommend procedures to improve the amenability of visualizations in specific communities. Additionally, our automated approach bestows an improvement in the semantic characterization of the colormaps in charts through the exploitation of the textual features therein, a preeminent operation in the adequate communication of the data's visually encoded statistical attributes for the dim-sighted.
I guess we could incorporate the textual features within the legends to semantically characterize the color encoding, which is appropriate for generating a natural language description of the visualization.
Importantly, these scenarios could be examined in controlled data sets, instead of in massive and complex figures as in the VIS' images.</p>

 <p> Title: SDA-Vis: A Visualization System for Student Dropout Analysis Based on Counterfactual Exploration </p>
 <p> Abstract: High and persistent dropout rates represent one of the biggest challenges for improving the efficiency of the educational system, 
  particularly in underdeveloped countries. A range of features influences college dropouts, with some belonging to the educational field and others to 
  non-educational fields. Understanding the interplay of these variables to identify a student as a potential dropout could help decision-makers 
  interpret the situation and decide what they should do next to reduce student dropout rates based on corrective actions. 
  In this presentation, I will present SDA-Vis, a visualization system that supports counterfactual explanations for student dropout dynamics, 
  considering various academic, social, and economic variables. In contrast to conventional systems, our approach provides information about 
  feature-perturbed versions of a student using counterfactual explanations. SDA-Vis comprises a set of linked views that allow users to identify 
  variables alteration to chance predefined student situations.</p>

<blockquote>
 <p> Organizer: Filip Sadlo </p>
 <p> Panelists: Claudio Silva (New York University - USA), Jorge Poco (Fundacao Getulio Vargas - BR) and Fabio Miranda (University of Illinois - USA)</p>
 <!-- <p> In recent years, research in urban, sports, societal and governmental data visualization have made tremendous progress, giving rise to successful visual analytic systems. 
  However, several open and provocative questions, mainly regarding ethic and fairness, are taking place. How the visualization community is handling those issues is the main topoic of this panel.
